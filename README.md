### Hi there, nice to meet you! ðŸ‘‹

Originally, I started out as a researcher in physics but I then transitioned into data science as I learnt more and more about machine learning and deep learning. I'm still new to the field but I'm a fast learner and a dedicated worker.  
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a small NLP project in which I'm analyzing the diverse topics of discussion in Reddit during the first COVID-19 year (2020).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning MLOps by following the course on coursera from Andrew Ng.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with landing my first job as a data scientist or ML engineer!
